# voidpack
Minecraft datapack for skyblock with structures. 

Currently has the folowing structures generating:
monuments, fortresses, bastions, ruinedPortals, strongholds, outposts, witchHuts

Notes:
Due to vanilla bugs the world seed is always "0". If you wish to change it change the "seed" perameter in voidpack/data/minecraft/dimension/overworld.json and voidpack/data/minecraft/dimension/the_nether.json
The end is currently untouched because otherwise the dragon fight breaks.
